One  day I accidentally saw a clip of a television interview. Conversation between a (very famous) sage and a journalist). Reporters ask, what advice can you give to people?. He replied: Go Travel!, your money will return but your time won't.

Just realized that the person being interviewed was Jackie Can, a martial arts expert.

So, by those quotes I have a hobby of traveling while bringing my mind to solving coding problems and what's surprizingly  
it works well and really fun!.
